## Hi, I'm Blessing Hirwa <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1303154/88677602-1635ba80-d120-11ea-84d8-d263ba5fc3c0.gif" width="28px" alt="hi">

I'm Blessing a student and open sourceror passionate about software engineering, science, blogging and music. From the moment I produced "Hello world" in the console of my first application, I knew I was hooked into the world of software engineering. But software engineering has never been "just a job" for me, it's offered me an engaging challenge to continually learn and improve my skills in creating high quality software. What started with a simple "Hello world" has become a full-fledged passion that only gets exciting as the years go by.
