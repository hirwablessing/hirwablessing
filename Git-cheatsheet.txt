How to remove the last commit on a remote repository 

-git reset HEAD^
-git push origin +HEAD^:master (here you can replace "master" with your own branch for example "login")

To force to remove the last commit from git,
use these 2 following commands:

git reset --hard HEAD^
git push origin -f

Be careful that this will create an "alternate reality" for people who have already fetch/pulled/cloned from the remote repository. But in fact, it's quite simple:

git reset HEAD^ # remove commit locally
git push origin +HEAD # force-push the new HEAD commit
If you want to still have it in your local repository and only remove it from the remote, then you can use:

git push origin +HEAD^:<name of your branch, most likely 'master'>
